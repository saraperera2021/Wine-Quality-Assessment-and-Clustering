# Wine-Quality-Assessment-and-Clustering

Developed a comprehensive program in R Studio to analyze a dataset comprising 2700 varieties of white wine from Portugal, focusing on their chemical properties and sensory quality rankings. Employed partitioning clustering techniques, including k-means analysis and principal component analysis (PCA), to identify patterns and groupings within the dataset. Key tasks included preprocessing steps such as scaling and outlier detection, determining optimal cluster centers using automated tools like NBclust, Elbow, Gap statistics, and silhouette methods, and evaluating cluster quality through internal evaluation metrics like silhouette plots and Calinski-Harabasz Index. The program facilitates a deeper understanding of the relationship between chemical properties and sensory quality in white wines, aiding in quality assessment and certification processes in the wine industry
